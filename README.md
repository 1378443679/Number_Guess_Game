ðŸŽ¯ Guess the Number â€“ Terminal Game (Python)
This is a simple number guessing game built with Python. The player has 5 chances to guess the correct number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program gives feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.

ðŸ§  How It Works
The player is prompted to enter an integer between 1 and 100.
The computer randomly generates a number in the same range.
The playerâ€™s guess is compared to the computerâ€™s number:
If it's higher, youâ€™re told itâ€™s too big.
If it's lower, youâ€™re told itâ€™s too small.
If it matches, youâ€™re told itâ€™s the expected number.
The game runs for 5 rounds.

ðŸš« Input Validation
The game only accepts inputs between 1 and 100.
If the user enters a number outside this range, the program prints "unwanted range" and skips that round.

âœ¨ Features
Random number generation via Pythonâ€™s random module.
Simple feedback system based on comparison.
Basic input validation.
Great for beginner-level Python practice.
